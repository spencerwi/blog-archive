**All** have sinned. There is **none** righteous. 

It's pretty straightforward. No matter how "in-control" things seem to
be at any moment, you *will not* have it "all together" while
you're mortal. Period. You are **not** somehow intrinsically "above" any
sin. Quite the opposite: you are intrinsically inclined towards all
sin. Every intention of the thoughts of the heart of man is "only evil
continually", as Genesis 6:5 mentions. 

Feeling uncomfortable yet? Good.

The Christian life and walk leaves no room for complacency. As I've been
taught recently, there are two kinds of Christians: those who are
growing and those who are deteriorating. 

You *will* stumble, and for that God's grace is sufficient. But
may it never be that we "continue in sin that grace may abound"! (Romans
6:1)

We must constantly strive to glorify our God, to honor Him and to cling
fast to His statutes. We are to add to our faith virtue, and to our
virtue knowledge, and to our knowledge self-control, and to our
self-control steadfastness, and to our steadfastness godliness, and to
our godliness brotherly affection, and to our brotherly affection love. 

Got all that yet?

Yeah, me neither. This is why we **need** the grace of God. This is why
we **need** His strength daily to walk in His way. We are to diligently
seek him, not on our own power but through falling down on our faces in
recognition of our fallen state and pleading for His aid, His animation
in every step we take.

When Christ's power is our lifeblood, only then can our heart flow forth
with righteousness rather than continual evil.
