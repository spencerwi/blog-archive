On the way to my karate classes there's a church that is notorious for
the *really bad* messages on its sign -- ranging from sappy and empty
("if God had a refrigerator your picture would be on it") to just
flat-out strange ("whoever is praying for the heat please stop!"). (For
the record -- it's not the church whose sign is pictured beside this
post. Google Images provided me this particular photo.)

That first example -- the one about God putting your picture on the
refridgerator -- for some reason gave me pause. At first blush it seems
pointless and sentimentalized.

But it's actually symptomatic of a *real problem*. It's the spiritual
equivalent to that sniffle you get two days before bird flu hits.

 

The thing that makes it especially terrible is that it's all about us.
It's glorifying mankind paradoxically by way of reference to God's grace
-- sort of an emptier version of the "God loves you and has a wonderful
plan for your life" gospel (which itself is just the "prosperity
gospel"). It places the focus away from the greatness of God and ignores
the sinfulness of mankind wholesale. We may be forgiven, but it is not
as though we are perfected unsinning creatures. To the contrary, we are
flawed and rebellious humanity, and it's only by incomprehensible grace
that God accepts us at all.

We're not the adorable preschooler whose picture is on the
refridgerator, we're the crowd chanting for the death of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth.

This seems harsh, but it's an important perspective. Because without a
proper understanding of our own vile state, we neglect the beauty and
grace of what God has done -- and in so doing we disesteem that God who
created *and* redeemed us.

And even if we do not show this disdain, we often forget its purpose.
No, Christ did not die so that we could live forever. That is a gift of
His mercy, yes, but it's not the sum total of his eternity-transcending
design. He died on the cross, bearing our sins, for the same reason that
He created us in the first place: for His ultimate glory. 

The Genevan Catechism summarizes matters well:

> 1. *Master:* What is the chief end of human life?
> *  Scholar:* To know God by whom men were created.
> 
> 2. *M:* What reason have you for saying so?
>    *S:* Because he created us and placed us in this world to
> be glorified in us. And it is indeed right that our life, of which
> himself    is the beginning, should be devoted to his glory.
> 
> 3. *M:* What is the highest good of man?
>    *S:* The very same thing.

In describing the end of time, God tells Isaiah:

> **[Isaiah 60:19-22][1]**
> 
> The sun shall be no more
>     your light by day,
> nor for brightness shall the moon
>     give you light;
> but the LORD will be your everlasting light,
>     and your God will be your glory.
> Your sun shall no more go down,
>     nor your moon withdraw itself;
> for the LORD will be your everlasting light,
>     and your days of mourning shall be ended.
> Your people shall all be righteous;
>     they shall possess the land forever,
> the branch of my planting, the work of my hands,
>     that I might be glorified.
> The least one shall become a clan,
>     and the smallest one a mighty nation;
> I am the LORD;
>     in its time I will hasten it.

> **[1 Peter 4:10-11][2]**
> 
> As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good
> stewards of God's varied grace: whoever speaks, as one who speaks
> oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that
> God supplies---in order that in everything God may be glorified
> through Jesus Christ.
> To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

This is why, just a few verses later, Peter can encourage the believers
facing persecution to endure it in a manner that glorifies God:

> **[1 Peter 4:14-16][3]**
>
> If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because
> the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. But let none of you
> suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler.
>
> Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let
> him glorify God in that name.

This is a God-centric gospel. This is *the* Gospel: that for God's own
glory -- that His glory might be made known in awe and amazement to all
of mankind, He created *everything that exists* and appointed to all
things their times of birth and life and happiness and grief and pain
and joy and death so that His name would be known and exalted above all
of the things He had created.

A God-centric theology can withstand the weight of hardship bolstered by
the exhortation Peter gives. A man-centric theology is shocked when all
of a sudden it seems like God has taken our picture off of the
refridgerator.
