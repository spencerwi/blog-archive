I don't know what I'm doing.

Â 

I often like to fool myself into thinking that I know what to do in most
situations, or that I know how to handle most circumstances.

But I don't. And it's much better when I realize that.

When I'm confronted with my own weakness, with my failure to act or
react in the most God-honoring way staring me in the face, all that
misplaced self-confidence (confidence in self is always misplaced, I
think) gives way to humble recognition of what I am: sinful. Redeemed,
justified, in the process of sanctification, but imperfect and prone to
falter.

But that's how God is honored -- by using one of His weak creations for
the revelation of His divine will. His glory resonates all the stronger
for the frailty of the instrument in His hand.

No, my weakness is not my goal -- but it *is* my reality. I don't strive
to fail, but I do fail despite my strivings for success. And this should
not surprise me. I am not God -- *shocking*, I know -- and so I stumble.
And I cry out to my Father and my Redeemer for mercy and strength. For
forgiveness where I've faltered and strength not to falter again.

And His grace is sufficient for me, for His power is made perfect in my
weakness ([2 Corinthians 12:9][2]).
