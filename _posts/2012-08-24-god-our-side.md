As Christians, we can be confident in the victory of Christ Jesus. He is
Lord of all, and He has conquered every foe; all things have been made
subject to Him, including death itself ([1 Cor. 15:26-27][1]).

We are heirs to this triumph, as [Romans 8][2] tells us, so we *know*
that when we walk in obedience to our victorious King, we too will be
victorious.

 

The thing we tend to forget is that bit about walking in obedience. We
sometimes take it as assumed that our God-given victory extends to
everything we do, forgetting that in our fallen state we are prone to
sin against God. *Against* God, mind you -- that's what sin *is*
by nature.

God doesn't lose. It is not in the nature of the sovereign, omnipotent,
righteous Creator to fail in anything He desires.

So when we go against God -- that is, when we sin -- the outcome is
clear: we lose. We often bear some small measure of discipline for our
sin  (small contrasted with the penalty of sin -- death)  as admonition
from God to return to submission to Him.

 

So in conflict with others (and even in our daily routine) we have an
obligation to our Redeemer to examine whether we wear our Savior's name
to His glory, rather than trying to wield our heir status as a weapon
against those with whom we disagree.

Be wary of growing prideful about having God "on your side." That's a
backwards perspective. Instead, ensure that *you* are on *His* side --
that you keep His commands. Apart from Him there is no victory, because
in Him has *all* victory been secured.
