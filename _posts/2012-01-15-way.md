There is an idea I've heard recently that seems to have gained some hold
in the modern world that Jesus is a path to God.

Not *the* path, but *a* path. Jesus, in this view, is one of many ways
to right standing before our Creator, one (or more) of which a person
must choose for themselves from their own understanding.

I said I've heard it recently, but it's not a new idea. It is at its
foundation a very old sort of apostasy: the idea that Christ is
unnecessary for salvation -- that salvation and acceptance before God
can be gained through some other means.

This heresy may seem an artificially-easy target, yet even some
Christians have been ensnared in it -- so it should be addressed.

 

First, we know that mankind is, in a natural state, intrinsically
unacceptable before God and *incapable* of acting in a manner that is
pleasing to God. Genesis 6:5 says:

> [Genesis 6:5](http://www.esvbible.org/search/Genesis+6%3A5+/)
> 
> Every intention of the thoughts of *man's* heart *is* only
> evil continually.

Psalm 14:3 declares:

> **[Psalm 14:3][1]**
> 
> they have all turned aside...there is none who does good, not even
> one,

The book of Romans contains a strong indictment on humanity:

> **[Romans 1:18-21][2]**
> 
>  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
> and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the
> truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God
> has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his
> eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever
> since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So
> they are without excuse. For although they knew God, they did not
> honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in
> their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.

> [Romans 3:23][3]
> 
> For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

 

So man requires justification before gaining God's acceptance. But even
in the same chapter where Paul lays out his case against sinful
humanity, he makes clear the way to obtain that justification:

> [**Romans 3:24**][4]
> 
> and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that
> is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his
> blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness,
> because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.

Christ Jesus is the source of that redemption. And it is *only* Christ,
none other, than can provide this salvation:

> [Acts 4:10-12][5]
> 
> let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by
> the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God
> raised from the dead---by him this man is standing before you well.
> This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which
> has become the cornerstone. **And there is salvation in no one else,
> for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we
> must be saved.**

And it is not just Christ's apostles who preach this -- this is no
invented idea of the early church. Christ himself declared as much:

> [**John 14:6-10**][6]
> 
>  Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one
> comes to the Father except through me. If you had known me, you would
> have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen
> him."
> 
> Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for
> us." Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and you still
> do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How
> can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Do you not believe that I am in the
> Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not
> speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his
> works.

It is only through Jesus Christ, the Son of God, that we can be cleansed
from our sin and approach God the Father -- our Creator. It is because
He is God. "I and the Father are one", He declares (John
10:30).

 

This claim, therefore, that there are "many paths" to God and that Jesus
is one of them is therefore incompatible with what Jesus Himself said.
If you accept that Jesus is *a* path to God, you must accept that Jesus
is *the* path to God -- that He *is* God. Otherwise, you make Him to be
a lunatic or a liar -- neither of which can lead to a perfect, holy God.

 

I've said that this heresy of pluralism is not new. So to where then can
we trace it?

To Hinduism:

> As men approach Me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to Me.
> *[1. ][7]Bhagavad Gita 4.11*

To Islam:

> Say, "We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us, and what
> was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in
> what was given to Moses, Jesus, and the Prophets from their Lord. We
> make no distinction between any of them, and to God do we submit."
> *[9. ][8]Qur'an 3.84*

 

And thus, ultimately, to Satan, who <q>disguises himself as an angel of
light.</q> ([2 Corinthians 11:14][9]).

This is why we are cautioned to cling fast to the truth of God's
Scripture alone, giving no quarter to the dogma of a rebellious world
(with no apologies given to Mormonism):

> [**Galatians 1:6-10**][10]
> 
> I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you
> in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel---not
> that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want
> to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from
> heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached
> to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say
> again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you
> received, let him be accursed.  
>      For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I
> trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would
> not be a servant of Christ.

May we always seek to please God, our Creator -- not men. Even (or
rather, especially) when it means proclaiming *one* truth.
