When we sin, we often fear the ire of God, and try to hide ourselves
from Him, like our [ancestors in Eden once did.][2] In repentence, we no
longer love our sin, but we know that an unblemished, perfect God cannot
tolerate sin, and we know His wrath towards unrighteousness.  So we
leave the secure hiding place of God and hide ourselves <em>from
</em>Him. Psalm 139 tells us this is a fruitless endeavor:

> O Lord, you have searched me and known me!
> 
> You know when I sit down and when I rise up;
> 
>     you discern my thoughts from afar.
> 
> You search out my path and my lying down
> 
>     and are acquainted with all my ways...
> 
>  
> 
> ...Where shall I go from your Spirit?
> 
>     Or where shall I flee from your presence?
> 
> If I ascend to heaven, you are there!
> 
>     If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there!
> 
> If I take the wings of the morning
> 
>     and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
> 
>     even there your hand shall lead me,
> 
>     and your right hand shall hold me.
> 
> If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me,
> 
>     and the light about me be night,"
> 
> even the darkness is not dark to you;
> 
>     the night is bright as the day,
> 
>     for darkness is as light with you.
> 
> [Psalm 139][3]

Just like in the garden of Eden, God *will* find us. To flee Him
only increases our sin, it cannot hide it.

 

But like in Eden, if we return to our Father, humbled and penitent, and
confess our sin, while there will be discipline (because [the Lord
disciplines the one He loves][4]), there is promised reconciliation and
restoration in Christ Jesus. When we stop trying to cover our own sin,
Christ can cover our sin with His atoning blood, and *God* will
again be our hiding place, preserving us from trouble.
