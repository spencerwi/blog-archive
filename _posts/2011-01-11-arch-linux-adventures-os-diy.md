I've recently switched my laptop OS from Debian Linux to Arch Linux.

 

Put on your glasses and suspenders folks, it gets nerdy from here.

 

I was originally intimidated by the rather daunting [install
procedure][1] -- modifying core system configuration from a terminal
*during the install* the "hard way" struck me as terrifying.

 

But ultimately, what I've found is both an educational and, yes, an
overall much *easier* experience in many areas.  Educational, since I've
had to discover and configure things I didn't previously even know
existed -- /etc/rc.conf, anyone? Installing Xorg and a display manager
myself? These are tasks that I would have thought too far beyond my
reach.

So how've I managed to pull through? Well, that's the part that actually
makes things easier -- the ArchLinux community. Between the [wiki][2],
the [forums][3] and the [Arch User Repositories][4], it's actually
*simpler* to install and run bleeding-edge software and to find
answers to more complex problems. Because of the DIY nature of
ArchLinux, it tends to attract the sort of users who are willing to get
their hands dirty and tinker with the plumbing of things -- so finding
help for a particular finicky low-level problem is significantly easier,
because odds are someone else has grappled with it at some point
already.

 

The Arch User Repositories also deserve a second mention; because the
package format for Arch Linux (which is effectively source code with
something approximating a makefile) is so simple to build and maintain,
the already-savvy userbase is even more likely to have packaged any
given Linux app or library within weeks or days of its release, leading
to a bleeding-edge system that you know like the back of your hand.

 

Sometimes, doing things the "hard" way is the right way. Now if only I
could suppress the urge to continually tinker.
