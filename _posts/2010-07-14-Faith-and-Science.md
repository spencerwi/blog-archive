Recently the topic of "Global Warming" has been in the news quite a bit.
It is a topic near and dear to the pit of my stomach; I feel as though I
need to vomit upon hearing its propaganda.

Science, as it were, is now a religion. Those who panic over global
warming have an almost fanatical nature to their frenzied distressed.
They behave in a manner most detrimental to society, to themselves, and
to those around them.

Yet, this fanaticism is not based on fact. It is merely based on the
teachings of Albert Gore and a few like-minded scientists. In fact, the
earth has been shown to be in a cooling phase. The planet has not
displayed any measureable increase in temperature in the past 10 years.
In the past 100 years, the planet has only heated by slightly less than
one and a half degrees.

Global warming activists are undeterred by this, however; they continue
to fly about in their private jets and drive about in fuel-devouring
SUVs to various rallies and speaking events.

Why do I say all of this?

Because few Christians will. We who are accused of these actions do not
defend ourselves. We who should be lights by which the darkness is
proved fail to illuminate.

Let us stand up not for ourselves but rather for Christ. Let us boldly
declare that we have no inherent worth. Then from that platform let us
proclaim the source of all worth: Jesus Christ.

He who created the earth controls it and redeems its inhabitants.

Let us not be the dying man who refuses a hospital. Let us not be the
drowning man who refuses the lifeboat. Let us not be the starving man
who refuses a feast.

Let us be the messenger of the feast, the ship's officer offering
escape, and the paramedic offering a way to the Doctor.

The world must be shown their great need before they will accept help. A
man does not feel pressed to fill a gap that he does not know exists.

Let us challenge the fanatical faith of the Atheist; he firmly believes
that there is no god. He is the one who must have faith that all things
have some obscure origin.

Let us contend with the frenzied faith of the Relativist; he firmly
believes that nothing is absolute. He is the one who must have faith
that nothing can be proven.

Let us stand against the unfounded faith of the Communist; he firmly
believes that man is ultimately good. He is the one who must have faith
in a fallen society.

Let us defend our own faith with all vigiliance; if all other things
fall away, God still provides strength to do so.
