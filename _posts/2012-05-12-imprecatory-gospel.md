Every Christian loves the Psalms. Mostly. The oft-memorized Psalm 23 is
comforting and speaks of the Lord's mercy. Psalm 150 evokes the jubilant
sound of joyous musicians praising God.

And we love these happy Psalms. They're great.

 

It's just those imprecatory ones that many feel are....*less* great. Not
that any part of Scripture is bad -- all Scripture is the
divinely-inspired, inerrant Word of God. We just tend to squirm a little
more when we read of God "\[taking\] up the spear and the javelin"
against "the wicked."* *We are uncomfortable with the verbalization of a
*rejoicing* in God's wrath.

 

I think it's because we're reading them incorrectly. Let's look at Psalm
68, which in the ESV is given the heading "God shall scatter His
enemies" (so, y'know, *friendly* stuff).

 


> God shall arise, his enemies shall be scattered;
> and those who hate him shall flee before him!
> As smoke is driven away, so you shall drive them away;
> as wax melts before fire,
> so the wicked shall perish before God!
> But the righteous shall be glad;
> they shall exult before God;
> they shall be jubilant with joy!
>
> [(Psalm 68:1-3 ESV)][1]

Normally, we read this and see talk of God's enemies scattered, fleeing
before him, driven away "as smoke is driven away". "So the wicked shall
perish before God," declares the Psalmist.

And that's all true -- it's right there in the text. But there's that
second part we seem to skim right over:

>  
> But the righteous shall be glad;
> they shall exult before God;
> they shall be jubliant with joy!

This passage is a view into the Gospel. It's not some angry Hebrew poet
dreaming of a day of triumph over his enemies (though probably the
psalmist in question here -- King David -- *was* hoping for vindication
from God).

It's a simple statement about reality. God *will* triumph over His
enemies. But He also will make "the righteous" glad and "jubliant with
joy." 

So who're "the righteous"? All those who through Christ have been
accounted as such. We, once members of the "melting like wax" group,
have been brought by grace into the jubilant celebration. In three
verses, we see both the destruction that we've been saved *from* and the
victory we've been saved *into*.

*No* human can possibly be righteous unless Christ intercedes. There is
none righteous, and all of us in sin *deserve* to melt "as wax...before
fire". So for there to be *any* mention of "the righteous" being made
glad, it can only be an affirmation of divine mercy towards those God
has chosen to pardon. 

Psalm 68 -- and other imprecatory Psalms like it -- may not be "He makes
me lie down in green pastures", but it's no less joyful for God's elect.
