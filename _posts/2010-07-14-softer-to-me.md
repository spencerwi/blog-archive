How easy it is to complain during the hard times. Faced with adversity,
we often cry foul, cry out, or simply cry.

For the world, this is standard (and almost understandable) behavior.
They are hopeless, apart from God in a harsh world (though often of
their own making.)

For the believer, however, this is unnatural. Why should we, assured of
our eternal victory, complain of the momentary light afflictions of the
temporal battle? The jubilant victorious army does not hang their head
in weeping for the few battle wounds when their foe is routed and they
have no casualties.

Why therefore do we preoccupy ourselves with the passing afflictions we
face in a passing world? Is it not better to think joyfully of our
inevitable eternal glory before the throne of the Most High?

In the times of trial, we often look to Job, a man who faced much
affliction himself. Job remained steadfast in his faith in God until he
was spent. When he at last could pursue no more, he relented, and fell
before God bemoaning his (admittedly dire) fate.

And God answered Him thus:

> "Then the Lord answered Job from out of the whirlwind and said:  
>  'Who is this that darkens counsel with words without knowledge?  
>  Dress for action like a man. I will question you and you will make it
> known to me.
> 
> Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?  
>  Tell me, if you have understanding.  
>  Who determined its measurementsâ€"surely you know!  
>  Or who stretched the line upon it?  
>  On what were its bases sunk,  
>  or who laid its cornerstone,  
>  when the morning stars sang together  
>  and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" --- Job 38:1-6

God continues in this way, reminding Job of His own majesty and
sovereignty through the rest of chapters 38 and 39.

Faced with the power and the might of God, reminded of His sovereignty,
Job responds in chapter 40:

> "Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer you?  
>  I lay my hand on my mouth.  
>  I have spoken once, and I will not answer;  
>  twice, but I will proceed no further." --- Job 40:4-6

God, the Creator of the expanses of the heavens, the Divine Designer of
his perfect plan, controls all.
