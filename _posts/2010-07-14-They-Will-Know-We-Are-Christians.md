Where is the unity? Why do we fight, split, and schism?

Why do we fight? Because of disagreements. One person's idea conflicts
with ours. So we fight. But as Christians, this shouldn't happen. True,
we must steadfastly defend the principles of the Christian faith, major
doctrines of salvation and justification by faith. But these are not the
doctrines from which most fights arise.

We contend with one another over minor doctrines. "Oh, you paedobaptist!
How mistaken you are," we shout. "You immersion baptist! How vast your
error!" Do we elevate ourselves to the level of God our creator? Are we
arrogant enough to think our way the only correct way? We declare
ourselves sinners, yet cannot imagine being mistaken! When faced with
someone who differs in a minor doctrine, we attack their views! Have we
entirely abandoned Christian liberty?

We must evaluate: does their view conflict with major doctrines of
Christianity? If the answer is yes, they are not actually Christians. If
no, can we not disagree on this point yet live in harmony? Preserve the
truth, yes, but not at the cost of destroying all bonds of unity! God
does not take pleasure in the wise man on the mountaintop alone with his
thoughts; He delights in the joyful singing of the congregation lifting
praise to Him.

Remember, as fallen sinners, we are not perfect. We do not have a
complete understanding of all things.

"It is not bigotry to be certain we are right; but it is bigotry to be
unable to imagine how we might possibly have gone wrong." -- G. K.
Chesterton

Why then do we seek to tear each other down? Why do we destroy the bonds
of fellowship with one another and call each other a fool? Why must we
always be right?

We should be spreading a message of love to the unsaved world; how can
we do that when we cannot love each other?

Rather, let us "major in the majors" and "minor in the minors." Let us
build each other up instead of tearing each other down. Let us guard the
integrity of our brother, rather than assaulting it.

And above all, let us bring glory to God our creator.

>  We will work side by side.  
>  And we'll guard each man's dignity and save each man's pride,  
>  And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love,  
>  Yes they'll know we are Christians by our love.
