Who can stand in judgment of that which Christ has declared clean?
Certainly not I. I cannot lift the gavel.

What grip can sin claim on me, if the Image of Perfection calls me His
own?

When my Savior bore the full wrath of my God, He destroyed my sin, my
shame, and my guilt. 

Why then would I hold more tightly to that annulled shame than to the
joy of my redemption?

Where now is my accuser? I've been acquitted. Only the court of my own
mind passes judgment on me; in an unjust arbitration I sit at both the
bench and the dock, barring entry to my Advocate in cosmic perjury of
the oath of allegience I've sworn to my King.

How then can I do anything but rejoice? There is now no condemnation for
me; I am in Christ Jesus.

 

My case is dismissed, and my charges dropped. Praise to my Defense.
