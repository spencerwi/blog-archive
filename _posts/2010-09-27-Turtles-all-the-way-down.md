In browsing the internet, I came across this quote from one of Stephen
Hawking's books, rather presumptuously titled "A Brief History of
Time"\:

> A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a
> public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around
> the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast
> collection of stars called our galaxy.  
>  At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room
> got up and said:  
>  "What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate
> supported on the back of a giant tortoise."  
>  The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, "What is the
> tortoise standing on?"  
>  "You're very clever, young man, very clever", said the old lady. "But
> it's turtles all the way down!"

This story is meant as a sort of wink-wink, nudge-nudge mocking jab
among secularists at those *ridiculous* religious nuts. After all,
science provides answers to such questions without resorting to
*fantasies*.

I write this in a rather tongue-in-cheek manner. The secular scientific
community has certainly *tried* to provide answers. One such attempt is
the idea of [abiogenesis,][1] which states that life can rather
spontaneously arise from nonliving matter. In a series of experiments,
scientists showed (somewhat tenuously) that given the right set of
specific circumstances (specifically, those modeled after some
manufactured idea of an "[earth before life][2]", amino acids, the
building blocks of <span class="caps">DNA</span> can form from nonliving
materials.

This merely puts off the problem, not actually answering the question
but promising an answer somewhere earlier along the chain. How did these
circumstances arise? Where did these nonliving materials come from?

To provide an answer to this, many have suggested the [Big Bang
theory][3] (yes, really!) This theory states that all matter in the
universe (since [matter can not be created or destroyed by natural
means, but at best converted to energy][4] ) once existed in a single
highly-compressed, superheated point in space. This highly-compressed
matter then began to expand (and cool down), forming the universe we
know today.

But where did this highly-compressed matter come from? And why would it
sit idle for the infinity before its decompression, only later to
[spring into motion?][5]  
 In what sort of expanse did this matter exist? Space? A void?

It's turtles all the way down.

Here I take a more audacious stance: I believe in an [causeless
cause.][6]  
 I believe in a God who existed before there was time, and will exist
afterwards. I believe in an omnipotent, omniscient God, who designed and
crafted everything past, present and future to exacting, intricate
detail, long before there was anything.

I believe that in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth,
that when the earth was formless and void, the [Spirit of God hovered
over the face of the waters][7]

I believe in a Creator who was not and did not need to be created, a
Designer who *knew* me specifically *before* [He formed me in the
womb][8]

I believe that before Abraham *was* (the earliest patriarch the Hebrews
could trace), that [God *is*.][9]

Anything else is, frankly, a *fantasy*.
