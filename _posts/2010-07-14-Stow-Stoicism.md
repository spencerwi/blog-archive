I recently heard someone speaking on bullies. This response led me to
give the subject more research, being a homeschooler. The consensus is
to just ignore the problem. The more I read, the more it became evident
that this is commonly considered the best solution.

It struck me. This is not courage. This is not bravery. This is
Stoicism.

Stoicism is simply an extreme form of apathy. It is to be apathetic even
to the point of not caring what happens to oneself. It is, in a
nutshell, disregarding everything and judging everything to have no
value.

How arrogant!

If the almighty Creator of all things deems us to be of enough value to
send His only Son as a repayment for *our* transgressions, how can we
claim that nothing has value?

Do we really suppose our understanding to be greater than the Lord of
Hosts? Do we really elevate our intellect above the King of Glory who
created all things and who alone knows and understands all things?

However, take heed; do not think too highly of yourself! You have value
only because God assigns value to you. You only have the worth that God
gives to us in His love.

But we do have this worth! Let us not be consumed by apathy. Let us
instead turn to God in times of strife or pain!

I would presume to correct the speaker: the correct response to threats
is to express God's love! Our life belongs to God. It is not ours to
throw away or disregard; It is His, with which to glorify Himself!

Let us not be careless stewards of His gift of life. Let us bring glory
to Him in all things. Let our words praise His majesty, our actions
express His love, and our hearts rejoice at His mercy.
