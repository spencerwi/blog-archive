Strength. The word evokes imagery of muscle-bound bodybuilders,
grotesque wrestlers, champion boxers. These, surely, are formidable
figures. They display great might and intimidating power. But what they
showcase is not strength, but mere might.

Strength is like courage; it is an elusive thing often claimed by those
who misunderstand it. The intimidating wrestler who defeats all others
is said to be strong, but he is in fact only mighty and perhaps, in a
limited way, powerful.

Strength is shown by the lowest-paid employee who continues working to
his fullest despite constant pressure from bill collectors. Strength is
shown by the unjustly imprisoned man who quietly prays in his cell for
freedom.

> "The Lord is the strength of his people; he is the saving refuge of
> his anointed." --- Psalm 28:8

Strength is shown in moderation. The truest strength stems from the
firmest of faith; to rely fully on what you cannot see when all that is
visible seems against you.

> "For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. Your restoration
> is what we pray for. " --- 2 Corinthians 13:9

Strength is shown in the man who can master his temper and swallow his
pride, the man who can be unjustly accused yet remain meek.

> "For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults,
> hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am
> strong. " --- 2 Corinthians 12:10

Strength is shown in the man who has authority; the man who can resist
the temptation for abuse and contain the pride that power brings.

> "We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the
> weak, and not to please ourselves." --- Romans 15:1

Do we have the strength to be weak?
