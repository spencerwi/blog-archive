So, coming back from a work seminar, I reflected on one of the little
"activities" there. This being a Chik-fil-a seminar, the emphasis was on
quality service. So, we did a "roleplaying" activity. I'll be the first
to admit, it was awkward and seemingly kinda stupid.

Riding home, I thought "man, that was pointless. Why'd we even do it?"

Then it struck me. Pointless?

What isn't pointless? Solomon's words in Ecclesiastes entered my mind:
"Everything is meaningless! What does man gain from all his labor at
which he toils under the sun?"

And so it seems. Stupid "highschool drama," petty fights, strivings for
material possessions; these things are certainly meaningless. There is
no value in them.

What is value? Economics cannot hold any answer here; this is too deep
and broad a subject. It covers not the mere tradings of goods and
services; it covers the spending and saving of time.

What determines value in matters of time?

Doing good. Seems superficial? Not quite.

> "In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your
> teaching show integrity, seriousness" --- Titus 2:7
> 
> "To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and

In doing good, we spread the glory of God. We show His love to all
people.

So value in temporal terms is found in bringing glory to God.

So, is an exercise in "operating excellence" and "2nd mile service"
pointless and devoid of value?

No (and yes,) I would contend.

This exercise is intended to teach us better respect and conduct towards
customers. The focus of the 1-day seminar surprised me; it was
Scripture-based. The intention was stated over and over: better service
to better glorify God.

So, ideally, the idea is not pointless.

Now, in execution, I admit, the idea was pointless. The situation was
awkward and could not possibly reflect on daily (working) life.

But let us not be too quick to judge! Our time is not our own to spend;
it is the Lord's! He grants each second to us on loan; let us turn a
profit on it. Let us gain a return on it.

Let us proclaim the glory of His name to unbelievers, and let us build
up fellow believers. When making decisions, let us weigh carefully;
which path most glorifies God?

And most of all, let us not get caught up in the distractions of this
world. All things here shall pass away, fading away before the splendor
of the King of all creation.

Let us seek to honor Him who gave us His life; who spent His time on
this earth to die for us and redeem us for His glory.
