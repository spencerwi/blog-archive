Every summer, I try to finish reading "Orthodoxy" by G.K. Chesterton,
and every summer I manage not to finish by way of stopping to take notes
every few pages. Already this summer I'm almost done (but I cheated -- I
picked up where I left off last time).

 

In reading, I came across this bit of wisdom:

> Long words go rattling by us like long railway trains. We know they
> are carrying thousands who are too tired or too indolent to walk and
> think for themselves. It is a good exercise to  
>  try for once in a way to express any opinion one holds in words of

> you can go on talking like that for hours with hardly a movement of

> go to gaol and Brown to say when Jones shall come out," you will
> discover, with a thrill of horror, that you are obliged to think. The

It got me thinking: there are in this world a lot of foolish ideas
hiding behind a curtain of large, empty words. Big lofty scholarly
words, like "Humanism", "postmodernism", and "philosophical naturalism".
But when you boil these concepts down to their core, it becomes clear
that there is no core remaining -- everything has gone up in smoke and
steam. "Humanistic Secularism" says nothing more than "only those things
we see are true." -- or in other words, "if I can't see it, it doesn't
exist." And yet the fact that some things *can* be seen is proof
enough of the things which can't be seen -- everything that can be seen
must have arrived to existence somehow, and nothing that we see now can
be its own maker. "Postmodernism" simply says "nothing is *really* true 
-- especially not the things we thought true before." And
"Philosophical naturalism" says nothing more than "everything happens
naturally" -- which is especially empty, since it defines "naturally" as
simply "the way we see things now."

 

Many non-Christians claim Christianity to be false by saying that it is
simply yet another form of the "monomyth", a kind of story that has been
discovered to be common to cultures throughout the world. And maybe they
are right in their comparison -- but shouldn't that simply confirm and
reinforce the truth of Christianity? If it is foolish to believe
Christianity simply because it is so similar to what every culture has
once believed, it is even more foolish to *disbelieve* Christianity simply 
because every culture has believed something so
similar to Christianity. "For since the creation of the world God's
invisible qualities", declares Paul in Romans 1, " -- His eternal power
and divine nature -- have been clearly seen, being understood from what
has been made, so that people are without excuse." Every nation on earth
has once believed in the story of creation because God has made clear to
every nation that same story.  The fact that man has distorted that
story does not disprove the truth of the original -- it only proves the
truth of God's word further: "for although they knew God, they neither
glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but their thinking became
futile and their foolish hearts were darkened."

 

And even that clear truth that can be seen has been challenged. The
"many-worlds hypothesis" tries to combat the idea that every
finely-tuned orderly part of creation points toward a personal and
intelligent creator by saying that of course *our* world is
orderly, but there exists another world that is not orderly. Not only
are we the product of random chance, but we simply happen to be the
"winners" of those millions of chance happenings that would lead to a
universe so perfectly designed as ours. But this again is empty -- they
attempt to answer the question of how we could possibly have by chance
defeated incalculable odds to arrive at a universe that is laid out
exactly to support life by simply repeating that we have by chance
defeated those odds and now live in a universe laid out exactly to
support life. They answer the question with the question, and go round
in round in circles like this until it becomes pointless to ask them any
longer. 

 

When you force yourself to stop and state the things you hold true in a
blunt, one-syllable way, then you come to learn if what you believe is
really believable. This is when you find that your mind must really
start to work -- and when it is made clear that Christianity can answer
what the world cannot.

 

"Why is Christianity so like what all people say is true?" "Because it
*is* the truth all people know." 

"How is the world so well made?" "Because it was made so well."
