Human nature seeks a role model. People tend to look for a person whose
behavior they wish to emulate, whether conscious or otherwise.

These role models are by definition influential; they have great power
to mold the lives of others through their own behavior.

Human nature also tends towards pride. In our fallen state, every person
wishes to be of greater worth than others.

Trouble arises when these two behaviors collide. Men raise themselves up
based on their perceived merits and look to gather a following. Such men
can often seem winsome, with intelligent-sounding speech and an attitude
of authority (though the authority they claim is not theirs.)

> "For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives
> himself." --- Galatians 6: 3

These men, says God, are nothing and deceive themselves.

Furthermore, they disobey God's command:

> "For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think
> of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober
> judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has
> assigned." Romans 12:3

Even Paul, a chosen Apostle of Christ, claims no authority of his own.
Notice the first sentence: "For by the grace given to me I say..." He
willingly acknowledges his own lack of position or authority; he
attributes this authority to Christ alone. It is only by the grace given
to him that Paul is able to say these things.

The true role model is not the man who says "look to me because of my
intelligence!" It is not the man who says "look to me because of my
strength and military training."

The true role model is Christ.

> "Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children." --- Ephesians
> 5:1

We are as children of Christ, commanded to imitate our Father. And what
more perfect model could we choose than the source of perfection and
righteousness?

Can we learn from the experience of fellow believers? In today's society
of arrogant salesman and prideful politicians, is there any man from
whom we can learn? Yes!

> "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ." --- 1 Corinthians 11:1

But note how Paul phrases this statement: he still claims no authority
of his own. "Be imitators of me," he says, but quickly acknowledges
Christ as the source of authority: "**as I am of Christ.**"

A good human role model will not only mimic Christ, but will point to
Christ constantly, giving Him the glory for any good that the role model
might achieve.

Choose carefully who you imitate; do your role models point to Christ,
or do they claim authority through the weak training of fallen men? Do
they find worth in Christ alone, or do they boast of their own
intelligence or skillful speech?

Look to Christ.

> "Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven,
> for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those who walk
> in pride he is able to humble." --- Daniel 4:37
