The (post-)modern idea of universal relativity is counterproductive. It
impedes, even denies improvement or progress. If there is no absolute
good thing, then there is no goal to which man can attain in a
measurable way.

One cannot speak of the historical march of progress without first
assuming a fixed common goal by which to compare. To say that we are in
some way better or worse off than our forebears requires first some
measure of what is better and what is worse --- a measure that must be
common to both in order to allow comparison.

It is impossible to say that we have progressed towards our desired end
if that end has been altered --- if the desired end is altered, we no
longer strive for our original target but have instead begun to seek
after a new one. As Chesterton says, "how can you overtake Jones if you
walk in the other direction?"

"But," the relativist might answer, "there is some observable change,
and by that change we may compare." This is, of course, an equally
ridiculous prospect --- while we may see that there is some difference,
that difference has no intrinsic value --- it is like a man who sets out
to craft a measuring stick by measuring the stick against itself.

For a man to better himself, he must first know what is better and then
seek after it. This goal must also either be sought by others or be
absolute --- otherwise it is not a desirable improvement, but is instead
a mere empty means of occupying time.

But the nature of man reviles stagnation --- there is always a desire
for motion, for improvement. Mankind is built for improvement. There is
within humanity, therefore, an inborn knowledge of the absolute.

The absolutes of Christianity fill this void perfectly --- and how
clearly so! The keyhole of our longing is made to fit the key of God's
Word.
