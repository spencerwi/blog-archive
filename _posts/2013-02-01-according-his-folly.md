Proverbs 26 has this seemingly contradictory pair of admonitions, back
to back:

> Answer not a fool according to his folly,
> 
>     lest you be like him yourself.
> 
> Answer a fool according to his folly,
> 
>     lest he be wise in his own eyes.
> 
>  
> 
> [(Proverbs 26:4-5 ESV)][1]

How can we follow two instructions that seem to be so directly counter
to one another? By understanding that the shortcomings of the English
language do not nullify the value of God's word.

 

First, let's look at some surrounding context in Proverbs. What defines
a fool's folly?

There are plenty of passages in the chapters immediately preceding that
define wisdom:

> He who loves purity of heart,
>     and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend.
> The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge,
>     but he overthrows the words of the traitor.
> [(Proverbs 22:11-12 ESV)]()
>  
> Make no friendship with a man given to anger,
>     nor go with a wrathful man,
>     lest you learn his ways
>     and entangle yourself in a snare.
> [(Proverbs 22:24-25 ESV)][2]
> 
>  
> 
> A word fitly spoken
> 
>     is like apples of gold in a setting of silver.
> 
> Like a gold ring or an ornament of gold
> 
>     is a wise reprover to a listening ear.
> 
> Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest
> 
>     is a faithful messenger to those who send him;
> 
>     he refreshes the soul of his masters.
> 
> Like clouds and wind without rain
> 
>     is a man who boasts of a gift he does not give.
> 
> With patience a ruler may be persuaded,
> 
>     and a soft tongue will break a bone.
> 
> [(Proverbs 25:11-15 ESV)][3]

We see that wisdom speaks the truth with grace, trusting that the Lord
will vindicate. Wisdom does not follow the ways of a wrathful man,
entangling itself in a snare.
 
So this explains the first exhortation, that we answer not a fool
according to his folly: that is, don't meet foolishness with
foolishness.
 
The second exhortation is unpacked in verses that follow our perplexing
passage:
> Like a lame man's legs, which hang useless,
> 
>     is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
> 
> Like one who binds the stone in the sling
> 
>     is one who gives honor to a fool.
> 
> Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard
> 
>     is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
> 
> Like an archer who wounds everyone
> 
>     is one who hires a passing fool or drunkard.
> 
> Like a dog that returns to his vomit
> 
>     is a fool who repeats his folly.
> 
> Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes?
> 
> There is more hope for a fool than for him.
> 
> [(Proverbs 26:7-12 ESV)][4]
> 
>  
> 
> Better is open rebuke
> 
>    than hidden love.
> 
> Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
> 
>    profuse are the kisses of an enemy.
> 
> [(Proverbs 27:5-6 ESV)][5]
> 
>  
> 
> Iron sharpens iron,
> 
>    and one man sharpens another.
> 
> [(Proverbs 27:17 ESV)][6]

The fate of a fool allowed to continue in foolishness is a dire one; he
becomes useless, a "thorn" to others, and a wound to everyone. To allow
a foolish man to remain wise in his own eyes is to condemn him to this
end. 
If we care about this person -- if we love him as Christ commands -- are
more faithful and more loving to offer rebuke when it's needed to save
him from such a disaster.
 
We're commanded to love our neighbor as ourselves, and it's precisely
that command that dictates that we help guide back a neighbor turned
towards a terrible end. But that love must also form and inform the way
we do so -- not with retaliation or mockery, but with the grace we've
been given.
