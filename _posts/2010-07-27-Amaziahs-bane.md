Amaziah is not a king who is often discussed, nor do we hear much about
him. He ruled Israel, is briefly described somewhere in Chronicles, and
we move on.

But something here bears closer examination:

> "And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, **yet not with a
> whole heart.**"

Amaziah obeyed God, even following in Gideon-like footsteps in one of
his only acts described in the chapter. As Amaziah prepares for battle
against the Edomites, he musters his own people as well as the army of
Israel. But God commands Amaziah to dismiss the Israelites, saying:

> "Why should you suppose that God will cast you down before the enemy?
> For God has power to help or to cast down."

Amaziah complies.

> "And Amaziah said to the man of God, "But what shall we do about the
> hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel?" The man of
> God answered, "The Lord is able to give you much more than this." Then
> Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim to go
> home again."

Trusting God's power, Amaziah dismisses the army and marches to battle
with diminished forces. And God grants him victory.

But then something happens.

> "After Amaziah came from striking down the Edomites, he brought the
> gods of the men of Seir and set them up as his gods and worshiped
> them, making offerings to them. Therefore the Lord was angry with
> Amaziah and sent to him a prophet, who said to him, "Why have you
> sought the gods of a people who did not deliver their own people from
> your hand?" But as he was speaking, the king said to him, "Have we
> made you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?" So
> the prophet stopped, but said, "I know that God has determined to
> destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my
> counsel.""

When the battle was over, Amaziah no longer seemed to think he needed
God. Instead, he turned to boastfulness and to the idols of the very
people God had just given over to him.

> "And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, **yet not with a
> whole heart.**"

This was his downfall; he did not follow God with a whole heart. Without
an all-pervasive focus on God and His glory and His law, Amaziah
succumbed to pride and idolatry."And he did what was right in the eyes
of the Lord, **yet not with a whole heart.**"

How can such a thing happen? How can a king who's **just returned** from
having seen God's power on the battlefield turn so quickly away?

Imagine for a moment that you are physically standing before God's
throne, with His perfect gaze upon you. In the face of this eminent,
awe-inspiring holiness, how inclined would you be to break the law of
God?

Now, consider this: that mental image is a reality. God's divine gaze
**is** upon you. It always has been and always will be.

All our lives, we've been prone to Amaziah's bane: halfheartedness and a
lack of total focus on God. With the proper focus, our sin seems even
more defiant; it is no longer a secret stumbling but a brazen rebellion
against God to his face.

And yet, this same God against whom we so often raise our fists, this
perfectly just judge who has seen our every insurrection, yet forgives
and redeems us to bring us into unity in His sight.

How can we have anything *but* a whole heart?
