Just a couple of quick verses that've been rumbling about my head
recently.

> I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived
> your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no
> opportunity. Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have
> learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be
> brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance,
> I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and
> need. I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
> 
>  
> 
> And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in
> glory in Christ Jesus. To our God and Father be glory forever and
> ever. Amen.
> 
>  
> 
> ([Philippians 4:10-12,19-20 ESV][1])

Contentment is not just about being satisfied with what you have -- it's
about *knowing* that God is sovereign, and that His will is best. It's
not about not wanting more, it's about being certain that our Father
will provide all that is necessary for accomplishing our purpose: His
exaltation.

> "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and
> it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one
> who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or which
> one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or
> if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are
> evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will
> your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
> 
> ([Matthew 7:7-11 ESV][2])

So what then should we ask for, if we know that He will provide?

For faithfulness, so that we glorify Him in our actions and to overcome
our sin that the King's majesty would shine clearly in us.

For boldness, so that even *every* *thought* would be* *driven by
confidence in the Creator's omnipotence.

And for humility and grace, so that we would daily recall the sacrifice
of our Redeemer, who saved we His enemies from a complete depravity of
mind -- and without whom we would be as shackled to sin as any lost
soul.
