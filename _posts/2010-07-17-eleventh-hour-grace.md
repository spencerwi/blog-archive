I have heard before the objection made to Christianity that it isn't
fair. That vicious murderers and killers and international terrorists
could be allowed into God's eternal rest, if only they truly repent and
follow Christ, honoring Him as their Savior.

Surely, the objection goes, a God who is fair to his lifelong followers
who in many cases suffer for His sake shouldn't regard these latecomers
as equal to the long-faithful.

> **Friend, I am doing you no wrong...do you begrudge my generosity?**

It is not out of unfairness that God offers such sweeping salvation.
After all, though we may not kill, we have all certainly at one point
become angry; God regards the two as equal offenses.

And though we may not embezzle on a grand scale, certainly there is no
one who is entirely innocent of greed.

And so it goes down the list of any charge that may be levied: though
our offense may not be vast, it is still an offense.

Though the tablets of God's law are not cast off a cliff, they are
nonetheless shattered. *All* have sinned and fall short of the glory of
God. There is *none* righteous; no, not one.

So why should a vile sinner who seeks forgiveness sooner be treated more
favorably than a vile sinner who seeks forgiveness later? Is it truly
just to execute the one imprisoned serial killer and release the other
who confesses some remorse?

And so the true nature of the picture comes into focus; the forgiven are
no less guilty. We are by our nature no less deserving of eternal wrath
and torment. We hold only the distinction that we have already sought
and been granted grace. If another of our equal corruption seeks the
same grace, should he really be denied?

The Christian is a man who, once placed on death row, has acknowledged
guilt and been pardoned. Why should the next man to repent *not* be
granted the same?
