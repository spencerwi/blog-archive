Too often, Christians fail to realize one critical fact about their
relation to mankind: Christ commanded love. This love extends not only
to Christian brothers, as is sometimes mistakenly thought, but to all
fallen creatures.

This love is to be unconditional.

> "But I say to you, **love your enemies and pray for those who

> sends rain on the just and on the unjust. **For if you love those who

> than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You therefore must
> be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.** " -- Matt. 5:44-48

Our motivation for this love is simple: We must be perfect, as our
heavenly Father is perfect.

"But *nobody's* perfect," we protest, "especially *certain*
individuals."

The Kingdom of God lies not in one's opinion of another, though we
should all "esteem others more highly than \[ourselves\]." Did Jesus
himself not go to the most reprobate of the same group whom He knew
would later crucify him? Was it not for these that Christ, in the midst
of unbearable torment and ***separation from God the Father*** cried
out, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do?"

None can fathom the depth of punishment faced by the Son of God who was
made to bear *all* sin for *all* people for *all* time.

And yet, he begged mercy for them, looking on them in pity.

> "Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his
> knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be
> accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities." --- Isaiah
> 53:11

How then can we, as imitators of this Suffering Servant, look in scorn
at any man? Can we, who are no better than fallen mankind, sit in
judgment?

Do we presume to sit in judgment not only of those in our same fallen
state, but of our Creator's sovereign plan?

Or how simple is it when expressed by Christ thus:

> "And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did it to
> one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me." --- Matt.
> 25:40

It is our task, as followers of Christ, to mimic Him, do as He commands,
and love unconditionally our fellow fallen creatures while we're given
the time on this fallen globe.

> "His image shown  
>  when we give our lives, our time, our own  
>  to feed, to clothe those in His image we have left alone.

We all, we all wear dignity; it covers the strong, the weak.  
 We all, we all wear dignity; even the last, the lost, the least

We all, we all wear dignity; God help the blind like me  
 Finding at last a voice we cry and see with clear unblinking eyes " ---
