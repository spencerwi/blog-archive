Humility is hard.

There are so many ways in which we are inclined to lift ourselves up --
to exalt ourselves in our minds (or seek to do so in the minds of
others) to a point of unassailable rightness. And it's subtle -- it may
not even be a conscious act of will. We simply cannot accept the idea
that our only "goodness" is extrinsic -- imparted to us by God.

Sure, we might know on an intellectual level what Scripture says about
us -- that our righteousness is as filthy rags (the original language
there in Isaiah 64:9 is *really quite strong* and worth looking
up), that our hearts are "only evil continually" (Genesis 6:5) and so
on.

 

But do you act on that? Do you fall on your face before God daily in
gratitude for an immeasurable gift undeserved? Do you consciously and
intentionally allow yourself to be diminished in all things that God
would be glorified? Is your driving motivation in every active decision
to live out the words of John the Baptist -- that "\[Christ\] must
increase, but I must decrease"?

 

I know I don't like I should. And I know that when I fail to do so, I am
in direct opposition to God.

 

God *opposes* the proud*,* says 1 Peter 5:5. He commands us
not to be "wise in our own eyes" in Proverbs 3:7 -- a clear command not
simply against outward arrogance, but against a mindset that esteems
one's self as praiseworthy. 

Romans 12 delineates our state more clearly still: "I say to every man
among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think,
*but to think with sober judgment,* each according to the measure
of faith that God has assigned." If we have a correct view of ourselves
in relation to God's perfection, pride is an impossiblity. In the
illuminating scrutiny of God's perfect standard, we cannot possibly
measure up.

*Every intention of the heart of man is only evil continually.*

That we should think in some way that our ever-faltering obedience to
God could earn us some merit is arrogant to the point of blasphemy. It
devalues the perfect work of Christ -- *perfect,* that is,
*complete*. Jesus paid it *all,* as the hymn says. When we think
for a moment that there is anything more we can add, we assert either
that there is some portion Christ could not pay, or that our feeble
piety could stand equal with Jesus's blood. Jesus Himself "did not count
equality with God a thing to be grasped." (Philippians 2:6). How can we
expect to fare better? 

*Our righteousness is as filthy rags.*

 

It's not enough to avoid active pride. We must actively seek to give all
glory to its rightful place -- the God who grants us every breath (to
say nothing of a regenerate heart and approval through His own blood.)

This is the fear of the Lord that Scripture calls the beginning of
wisdom -- that in gazing upon Him and gazing upon ourselves, we are
awestruck at the incomprehensible gulf between his perfection and our
own depravity. With this disparity impressed upon our hearts, we can
find contentment, love and faith beyond "rational" understanding.

Contentment, no longer striving to inflate or exalt ourselves. God is
all-perfect and all-loving towards us in His infinite grace.

Love, knowing that even the vilest of all sinners is no lower than we
ourselves -- weak and fallen, helpless apart from God's salvation.

Faith, trusting in Christ as the source of all good; He who began a good
work in us will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.
(Philippians 1:6). Our Creator, having once imputed to us Hist own
righteousness beyond understanding, does not cast us off in our
imperfection but instead reforms us into His glorious image -- unbroken
as before the Fall. Blessed indeed are the meek.

 

Humility is rewarding.
