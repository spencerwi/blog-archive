Ever feel like Job did there? Do you ever have a moment where you just
think, "look, God, I'm doing everything right! Why are you still so hard
on me? You're so cruel."

That may not be the thought verbatim, but it is the distilled essence,
and it reveals a disturbing tendency: unable to see our own sin when in
the midst thereof, we cast blame on God instead. Surely, since it's not
our fault (as far as we can tell), it must be God's fault. He's just
being mean or overreacting or something.

But stop! He is **God**. He is *by very definition* not cruel.

Far from cruel and belligerent, God **is love**, and he is our refuge in
times of trouble.

In our own hubris and self-pity, we forget one of the **very central
themes** of Christianity itself:

> "He who did not spare his Son but gave him up for us all, how will he
> not also graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge
> against God's elect? It is God who justifies." --- Romans 8:32-33

It is **God** who justifies --- apart from him there is no conception of
blamelessness. It is impossible to be guiltless and yet accused by God,
because **it is impossible to be guiltless at all**, unless God first
makes us so.

In times of trial, the correct response is not a retaliation of the
heart, but a careful examination thereof.

And of course, we do well to remember that trials from God are not His
wrath upon us, but His mercy to continually conform us to His image. If
we keep this in mind, our trust in God will be affirmed and solidified
during hard times, not eroded.
