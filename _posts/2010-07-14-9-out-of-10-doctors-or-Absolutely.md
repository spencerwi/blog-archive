This is just my opinion.

Or is it? Can I make a statement that is absolutely factually true,
regardless of societal preconceptions?

Yes.

The Book of Job provides a succinct example of common relativistic
thought in the form of the young man Elihu, who in his response to both
Job and Job's three "friends," says this:

> "Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who know; for
> the ear tests words as the palate tastes food. Let us choose what is
> right; let us know among ourselves what is good." â€" Job 34:2-4

Here Elihu states his position quite clearly: man can, through
experiential knowledge determine what is right. "Let *us* choose what is
right," he says, "let us **know among ourselves** what is good."

But what is the source of this knowledge? Elihu would assert that our
own experience dictates what is truth. But life experiences are wildly
variable and cannot be a reliable source for constant values.

So to resolve this issue, many turn to the common denominator;
majority-ruled morality. This meta-ethical relativism adds detail to the
issue of simple descriptive relativism, but doesn't provide a solution.
Ultimately, nothing can be constant because society is not constant.

Consider the issue of slavery. In most countries, by modern standards,
slavery is considered cruel and a violation of what most have "decided"
are basic human rights. And yet, these same countries once celebrated
slavery as a profitable industry that somehow allowed those deemed by
society to be superior to have time for things that were deemed more
important. This was the majority opinion, and so by meta-ethical
standards, this was truth.

Today, slavery is seen as wrong. The majority has deemed this to be the
case, and so by meta-ethical standards this is the case. But when did
the shift occur? In the moment that the majority opinion shifted, when
the balanced tipped even slightly, meta-ethical relativism denounced
slavery. Because the majority denounced it.

This system allows no room for character or conviction. If all things
are relative, then holding anything as wrong is only temporarily valid.
Why codify law? Why do we recoil when we hear of the brutality inflicted
by slaveowners? Why did the majority opinion shift? After all, slavery
was acceptable. Society deemed this as truth.

More dangerously still, meta-ethical relativism allows no room for fact.
Should the majority one day decide that higher levels of academic study
are too difficult and thus not worthwhile, our understanding of the
world would suddenly halt. And should this majority further decide to
reject our current body of research, our understanding of the world
would be corrupted. With no concept of more advanced physics and
chemistry, we would not be able to measure (or predict) natural
disasters. Hundreds or more lives could very factually and absolutely be
lost.

This may sound a distant paranoia, but as relativism grows mankind is
rejecting fact for vague feeling. Pride begins to conquer proof.

God provides *the* solution.

> "The sum of your word is truth, and every one of your righteous rules
> endures forever." â€" Psalm 119:160

God's word is truth. *Every one* of his righteous rules endures forever
--- regardless of society's changes.

> "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father
> except through me." â€" John 14:3

Jesus Christ, the Word of God made flesh, is The Truth.

> "I did not speak in secret, in a land of darkness; I did not say to
> the offspring of Jacob, 'Seek me in vain.' I the <span
> class="caps">LORD</span> speak the truth; I declare what is right."
> â€" Isaiah 45:19

This truth is not hidden, waiting to be discovered by society or
stumbled upon logically, but provided clearly in God's word.

> "Attempt to place our lives into Your hands, confide in what You'll
> do;  
>  because sometimes when you're trying to sleep  
>  and all your doubts and your faith don't agree it's 'cause  
>  sometimes the hardest thing to believe is the truth."
