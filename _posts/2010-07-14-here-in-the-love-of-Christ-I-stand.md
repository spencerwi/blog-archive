The Creator of the Universe has a plan for all things. How foolish am I
to forget that He who designed the vast reaches of space, He who
engineered the infinitesimal cells in our bloodstreams, He who precisely
coordinated the tilt of the earth's axis, the exact mixture of chemicals
in our air, the perfect distance from the nearest star; How could I
forget that He has a plan for my life?

How could I let a tiresome week or two drive the wonder of His power out
of my mind? How could I ever forget His promise in Jeremiah? "I know the
plans I have for you," He says. "Plans to keep, and not to harm you.
Plans to give you hope and a future."

How can I get so caught up in temporal events of my own minuscule
existence on earth that I cease to rest in Him? How can I worry about
tomorrow?

He who ordained all things before time began presides over all things
throughout time.  
 He who created all things has final authority and power over all things
for all time.  
 He who is truth itself, who is holy and steadfast in His promises will
not break His word, His promise that all things work together for my
good if I love Him and keep His commandments.

He who is merciful enough to give times of peace and happiness, and
loving enough to give times of sorrow, tiredness, frustration, or pain;
He will not abandon me.

He controls all! He is infinitely unfathomably vast in might and power!
Who can stand between Him and His plan for His creation? Who can
separate me from His love? Who can dare to resist His will, or dream of
standing against His might?

Nobody.

God's in His heaven, all's right with the world.
