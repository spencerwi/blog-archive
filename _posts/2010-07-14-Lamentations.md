By maternal request (request with weight, of course) I read part one of
Michael Card's *A Sacred Sorrow* last night.

In it, Card talks (obviously) about the importance of lamentations in
the Christian life. Not Lamentations, but lamentations. (i.e. not the
book.)

Without lamentation and weeping, salvation loses its weight. If the
sinner isn't confronted with the full weight of sin, crushed by it to
almost despair, they feel no need to be saved from it.

Without sorrow, there is no repentance. If our actions don't grieve us,
why apologize? Why repent? Why turn away from them?

This all struck me sharply; it seems set squarely against the notion of
joyous victory over sin, and rejoicing in Christ. Again, it seems so.

It isn't though.

>  A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a
> time to  
>  embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;  
>  A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast
> away;  
>  A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time
> to speak;  
>  A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of
> peace.
