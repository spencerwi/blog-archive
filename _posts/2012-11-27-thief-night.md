In my daily Bible reading, I came across 1 and 2 Thessalonians, which
deal quite a bit with the second coming of Jesus.

These passages in particular caught my attention:

 

> For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command,
> with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of
> God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive,
> who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to
> meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.
> Therefore encourage one another with these words.
> 
> Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need
> to have anything written to you. For you yourselves are fully aware
> that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While
> people are saying, "There is peace and security," then sudden
> destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant
> woman, and they will not escape. But you are not in darkness,
> brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief. For you are all
> children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of
> the darkness. So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep
> awake and be sober.
> 
>  
> 
> [(1 Thessalonians 4:16-5:6 ESV)][1]
> 
>  

Here Paul speaks very briefly about how the redeemed will be raised to
union with Christ. Note the emphasis: little detail, followed by an
admonition to encourage one another with that bit of truth.

 

The point of this passage is not to make us prophets and predictors of
the end times, but to remind us of the prize at the end of our race:
unblemished unity with our Savior at last. It's not to give us a sign so
that we can point it out and feel smug in our knowledge, but to
encourage us not to grow faint or lazy in our present time; to remain
on-guard and continue to serve God in sobriety of mind.

> Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being
> gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, not to be quickly
> shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a
> letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord
> has come. Let no one deceive you in any way.
> 
>  
> 
> [(2 Thessalonians 2:1-3 ESV)][2]

As we are not to try to make ourselves into prophets, we should beware
of those who do. "Let no one deceive you in any way," writes Paul. We
have been given by God, in His Word, as much insight into the last days
as we require. God alone is capable of describing to us His return, and
He has not chosen to do so. Rather than looking to man for extrabiblical
"wisdom", we ought to study what the Author of history has revealed to
us.
 
Throughout Scripture, when God *has* chosen to tell us about His
return, it is always with a purpose: to remind us to remain faithful
servants *now*. Even the book of Revelation follows this pattern; the
last chapter ends thusly:
 
> "And behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is the one who keeps the words
> of the prophecy of this book."
> 
> I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard
> and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who
> showed them to me, but he said to me, "You must not do that! I am a
> fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and with those
> who keep the words of this book. Worship God."
> 
> ...
> 
> I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if
> anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this
> book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this
> prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the
> holy city, which are described in this book.
> He who testifies to these things says, "Surely I am coming soon."
> Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.
>  
> [(Revelation 22:7-9; 18-21 ESV)][3]

Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! In the meantime, let us worship God and serve
Him humbly.
