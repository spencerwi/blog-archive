As the semester winds down, I've found some time for nonacademic reading
(though final exams have begun to erode that particular liberty).

 

In that reading, I've noticed an awful habit of mine: I tend to read
suspiciously. I don't mean that I crawl in a corner somewhere or obscure
the cover of my book -- I mean that I regard what I read (at times) with
perhaps *too* critical an eye.

It happened recently, in reading a book on theology. I'll omit
specifics. Suffice to say I arrived at a section discussing something of
a "hot-button" issue (there are a few of those in theology!), and the
author appeared to take a side opposite the view to which I'd become
accustomed. 

I say "*appeared*" not as a filler. The author was not advocating
anything untrue, nor anything with which I would even actually disagree.
But there was a single "signal word" of sorts that caught my attention
and immediately caused me to raise my guard. I was now shields-up, ready
to disregard anything that followed with which I might disagree.

What's followed, so far, is sound, Scripturally-backed doctrine. This is
not to be disregarded, obviously -- least of all in favor of my own
opinion.

As Christians, we're called to "test the spirits to see whether they are
from God", as it says in [1 John 4.][1] It is not wrong to be discerning
and cautious -- to the contrary, it's good. We're told to be wary of
anyone, even "an angel from heaven" preaching a gospel contrary to that
which was given to us ([Galatians 1:6-10][2]). 

 

But we -- I, really -- must not be unwilling to hear the truth.
Sometimes God's messenger is like Micaiah -- and I am [*not* to be
Ahab][3]. The Word of the Lord is not always that which fits nicely with
my understanding. *I* must conform to <i>Scripture, </i>not the other
way around. 

 

Equally disturbing in myself is the tendency I've noted to hold
unquestioning the views of those I've (at times subconsciously) deemed
"trustworthy". It is good to seek the counsel of godly men, especially
those who have been given greater wisdom than I have, but their word is
not to be taken as necessarily the same as God's Word. God alone is the
ultimate source of all truth; there can be no other contenders for that
title. He has revealed that truth to us in Scripture, and so Scripture
should be my final standard for truth.

If the gospel being preached is consistent with Scripture (not my
opinions on Scripture, but on what Scripture actually says), then it is
my duty as a disciple of Christ to heed it, to obey it, and to apply it.
