I came across this in my reading today:

> And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked,
> following the course of this world, following the prince of the power
> of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of
> disobedience---among whom we all once lived in the passions of our
> flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by
> nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being
> rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even
> when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with
> Christ---by grace you have been saved---and raised us up with him and
> seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in
> the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in
> kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved
> through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,
> not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his

Not only is salvation a gift of God, but Paul makes it clear that even
faith is a gift of God. We were dead and totally incapable of believing
in Him, desiring only "the passions of our flesh" when He created in us
a new heart in mind so that we might at least be able to cry out to Him.

 

This is why I would contend with the idea that God chose us because He
saw "down the corridors of time" that we would accept His redemption:
even our faith is not our own doing, because without Christ first
renewing us we cannot even *want* to be saved. The omnipotent sovereign
Creator of the universe is not subservient to our intellectual assent.

 

We were created to be redeemed and renewed, so that He might be
glorified by His act of mercy towards us.
