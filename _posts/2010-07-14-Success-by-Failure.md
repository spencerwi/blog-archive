We are human. We are imperfect. We, by definition, sometimes fail.

In a society driven by success, failure is deemed unacceptable.

It seems logical enough; if we have a goal, we want to attain that goal.
In not obtaining that goal, we do not fulfill whatever purpose is
attached to that goal. Thus, we fail. And since we want to attain that
goal, we do not want to fail. Since failure is something we do not want,
failure is bad.

Right?

Through failure, we are shown the depths of our weakness. This is
**crucial** to a healthy Christian walk.

We must be intimately aware of the fact that we are weak, fallen human
beings. If we are not aware of that fact, we are not aware of our need.
If we are not aware of our need, we do not rely on Christ for strength.

God is not glorified in a happy line of marionettes whose strings He
constantly pulls, controlling their every movement. He is glorified when
we imperfect humans learn to rely on His strength to overcome our sin
and actively do His perfect will.

It is a basic principal of leadership theory that you must allow those
you lead to fail occasionally. If you simply demand success on a
perpetual basis, success will seem a laborious task that they will
gleefully shrug off when not under your authority.

We learn through failure. Trial-and-error. It is the most effective way
for people to learn things unassisted.

The heroes of the faith listed in Hebrews are credited as heroes because
they learned to rely only on the Lord's strength and not their own.

> "And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon,
> Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophetsâ€" who
> through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises,
> stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the
> edge of the sword, **were made strong out of weakness**, became mighty
> in war, put foreign armies to flight." --- Hebrews 11:32-34

Failure is unacceptable as an end. Failure is a means to total
submission and realization of our weakness.

Rejoice; you are a greater sinner than you think.  
 Rejoice; you have a greater savior than you think.
