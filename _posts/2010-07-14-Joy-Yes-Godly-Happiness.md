Happiness vs. Joy. A common topic among Christian circles. The general
consensus seems to be that happiness, being a temporal state, is minor
and is even sometimes cast in an highly unfavorable light.

Let's *really* examine the subject; let's talk....*definitions.*

Joy is, according to John MacArthur, "...the flag that flies on the
castle of the heart when the King is in residence." Joy is the inner
peace given only by the Holy Spirit; it is that Pauline strength and
perseverance stemming from a knowledge of a heavenly rest and reward
that enables a pair of prisoners thrown under the jail to sing hymns and
praises to the King who grants them sweet release.

Happiness is an emotion. Beyond this, it's hard to describe without
comparisons. Happiness is being given the greatest gift ever; happiness
is, along with pride, when you watch your child excel at something.
Happiness is the wedding of a dear friend. It's the knowledge that
someone cares for you; it's winning and success; it's finally
accomplishing a life-long goal; reaching your childhood dream.

Happiness isn't wrong, is it?

It can't be. Surely not!

I mean, David was intensely felicitous at the return of the Ark of the
Covenant, right? Scripture says he danced with joy, but is it joy here
or happiness?

It's both.

Joy at pleasing the High King of All, and reaping an eternal reward in
the form of an eternity spent with Him.

Happiness at a triumphant success, at the exaltation of the Lord, and
the vanquishing of enemies.

Okay, so that's both Joy and Happiness.  
 Let's look at another example.

Paul and Silas were viciously beaten, stripped of all they had, and
thrown in the depths of prison; yet they sang praises to the Just Judge.

Joy. Sadness.  
 Joy, simply to be beaten for Christ's sake, to suffer for the truth and
still remain firm in faith. To mimic Christ --- even if just in a small
way --- in His suffering. To endure the pain and suffering and
humiliation and separation from all they cared about, and still be
solidly grounded in the True and Everlasting Rock.

Yet sadness; to suffer pain for what is right, to be beaten at the hands
of harsh and unsympathetic soldiers, to be sentenced to the coldest,
darkest, loneliest cell by unjust rulers, all for doing as their God
commanded. To seemingly be punished for obedience.

Joy. Sorrow.  
 A "Dr. K-ism" rings true here; "tears in one eye, and joy in the other
eye."

So joy is good! Joy in the Lord of Hosts is excellent and right and
true.

But let's not downsize happiness; surely God gives times of peace.
