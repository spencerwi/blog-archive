Once again, Fred Phelps of Westboro Baptist Church (in)fame [is making
headlines][1] -- this time due to Arizona emergency legislation passed
to preclude his organization's standard *modus operandi* -- picket signs
and shouting --* *at the funeral service for several victims of the
[recent shooting in Arizona that left six dead, including an Arizona
state representative and more wounded][2].

 

But I'm not here to talk about the politics of the affair, nor Phelps's
grotesque response to multiple homicide. I want to discuss something
else that has me more alarmed: the response *to* Mr. Phelps's sick
actions that I've heard in increasing quantity and volume from
Christians: "Hell will welcome him when he finally dies," I've heard.
"\[He\] will be known by \[his\] fruit." "He belongs in the pits of
Hell."

 

Let me back up for a moment to set the stage. A few years ago on
Facebook I encountered a group titled "Osama Bin Laden could get into
heaven." The name was obviously a shock title to get attention, but the
point was nonetheless well-made: if Bin Laden fell at the feet of
Christ, acknowledging his sin and pleading for forgiveness, forgiveness
is what he would receive, *eternally*. 

 

Fred Phelps, though he has not committed mass murder in the name of a
false god, has profaned the name of Christ before a lost world. Under
the law of the Ten Commandments, "the Lord will not hold him guiltless
who takes His name in vain." (Ex. 20:7). 

But have those who so gleefully declare that he will be known by his
fruit (Matthew 7:20) forgotten the words of Christ from only three
chapters before? 

> "You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not

> you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to
> judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council;
> and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire." --
> *Matthew 5:21-22 ESV*

Do we really think <em>ourselves </em>innocent of lawbreaking and sin?
We would do well to remember the oft-repeated words of Romans 3:23 --
<em>all </em>have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. It does not
say "nonbelievers have sinned", nor does it say "only the infidel has
sinned". <em>All </em>have sinned. Osama Bin Laden, Fred Phelps, and
Paul have all sinned. David, Abraham, and the Arizona sinner have
sinned.

 

The only distinguishing factor between the believing sinner and the
unbelieving sinner is the power and redemption of Christ. It is by
<strong>grace </strong>we have been saved through faith and that not of
ourselves; it is the **gift** of God, <strong>lest any man should boast.
</strong>(Eph. 2:8) If two murderers sit on death row awaiting their
sentence and one is pardoned, ought he to stand in condemnation of the
other murderer? 

Again, we seem to have selectively forgotten Jesus' words, ignoring
Matthew 7:1-5, choosing only to remember Matthew 7:20.

> "Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you
> pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be
> measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's

> there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log
> out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck
> out of your brother's eye." *-- Matthew 7:1-5 ESV*

What part of Christ's suffering was our accomplishment? What merit can
we possibly claim of ourselves that we should seek to condemn our fellow
sinful man? Let us instead seek his salvation and repentance! 

Because Phelps and his followers have wrongly condemned so many in hate,
are we given license to condemn him with that same hate?

We've become the Pharisees, throwing the adulterous woman at Jesus's
feet and voraciously demanding that he condemn her. Jesus's decree to
the Pharisees is equally applicable to us, if not more so for our
reliance on His grace: "Let him who is without sin among you be the
first to throw a stone at her." (John 8:7). Like the Pharisees, we must
simply leave this sinner in the hands of Christ.
