A friend reminded me recently of one of the crucial aspects of Christian
life: "this is our only time in eternity actively in the battle, and
it's short."

How true this is. As a soldier of the peace of God in the warzone called
earth, my service is brief but my cause is eternal.

> "As for man, his days are like grass;  
>  he flourishes like a flower of the field;  
>  for the wind passes over it, and it is gone,  
>  and its place knows it no more.  
>  But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting
> on those who fear him,  
>  and his righteousness to childrenâ€™s children,  
>  to those who keep his covenant  
>  and remember to do his commandments.  
>  The Lord has established his throne in the heavens,  
>  and his kingdom rules over all." --- Psalm 103:15-19

The things I do and say should be focused, driven for the purpose not of
my own passing existence, but of the very reason I exist: to glorify God
and enjoy Him forever.

To bring glory to His name. To honor Him. To love Him by keeping His
commandments.

To keep Him forefront in my mind, even when times are busy or the road
is flat; to remain vigilant in times of seeming peace.

To seek continually to grow in Him, never becoming complacent --- or
worse, apathetic --- in my relationship to my Savior and my God.

Not merely to parrot doctrines, but to live a loving relationship with
my righteous and merciful Father.

*This* is what I am called and created to do. *This* is the goal for
which I should strive.

And when the battle's over and victory's acheived, then can I rest.

>  'Til there's no more faith and no more hope,  
>  I'll see your face and Lord I'll know."
