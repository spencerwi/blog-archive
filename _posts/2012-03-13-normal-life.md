Spring break has ended. School has resumed. There is an assignment due
Monday and a test on Thursday. 

Some corner of my mind laments that I am no longer able to enjoy what it
deems "normal life" -- that *school* thing once again rears its
bothersome head and begins to take its place as the elephant in the room
that is my schedule.

 

But this *is* normal life. I don't just mean the mathematical fact of
percentage-of-time for the one outweighing the other; I mean the fact
that I am alive and breathing in another day which God has laid before
me.

 

Not another week or month or however-long-until-semester-end; just
another day. This is the day the Lord has made, I try to remind myself,
I *will* rejoice in be glad in it (whether I like it or not)!

Clearly I have a perspective problem. I'm not just called to survive
each day (with its work and school and homework) begrudgingly until I
can manage to come to day's end and clamber into the bed to sleep
satisfied simply with escaping another relatively intact.

I'm called to glorify God. I'm called [never to grow weary in doing
good, but to seize every opportunity.][1] I'm called [not to be
slothful, but fervent in spirit, serving the Lord][2] -- by [remaining
constant in prayer.][3]

 

I don't see any exception made in those verses for the time that my mind
has fabricated as prior to "real life". "Real life" is now -- it's from
the moment that God placed me on earth until the moment He takes me from
earth (and better still -- it continues from there!)

 

Just because I don't have a degree doesn't mean I can't glorify God in
my work -- rather *because* I'm still jumping through the hoops of
college, I have *more* opportunities to exalt Him. More
opportunities to share with classmates the peaceful shelter found in the
unwavering unchanging truth of the Gospel. This time I'd thought was
wasted in classrooms with unneeded material (because let's be fair, who
*really* needs to memorize analog-to-analog signal conversion
methods) is instead a frontline where I am called to serve.

 

So I pray that God strengthens me to seek Him in everything -- in "real
life" and real life -- and know that He is able to make His glory known
through me despite my weakness.

 

*Especially* when the homework is due Monday and the test is
Thursday.
